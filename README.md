# Dijkstra and Bellman-Ford Algorithms

This project combines the Dijkstra and Bellman-Ford algorithms to demonstrate shortest pathfinding techniques.

## Features:
- Implements both Dijkstra and Bellman-Ford algorithms in Python.
- Visual representation of the graph.
- Handles both connected and disconnected graphs.

## How to Run:
1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip3 install networkx matplotlib
